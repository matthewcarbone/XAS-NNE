XANES ML-ready ACSF database 22 June 2022
=========================================

**Filenames:** ``XANES-220622-ACSF-*.pkl`` (and ``XANES-220622-ACSF-*-small.pkl`` for a small random subset for debugging), where the ``*`` represents the absorbing atom type.

Processed from ``XANES-220622-C-N-O.pkl``. ACSF vectors computed using parameters

.. code-block:: python

   from dscribe.descriptors import ACSF
   species = ["H", "C", "O", "N", "F"]
   rcut = 6.0
   g2_params = [[1.0, 0], [0.1, 0], [0.01, 0]]
   g4_params = [
       [0.001, 1.0, -1.0],
       [0.001, 2.0, -1.0],
       [0.001, 4.0, -1.0],
       [0.01, 1.0, -1.0],
       [0.01, 2.0, -1.0],
       [0.01, 4.0, -1.0],
       [0.1, 1.0, -1.0],
       [0.1, 2.0, -1.0],
       [0.1, 3.0, -1.0]
   ]
   central_atom = ... # C, N or O, used later in the script
   acsf = ACSF(
       species=species,
       rcut=rcut,
       g2_params=g2_params,
       g4_params=g4_params
   )

Pickled file is a dictionary with keys ``grid``\ , ``y`` and ``x``\ , for the spectral grid, output spectra and input ACSF vectors, respectively. There are also keys ``names`` for the ``qm9id_atom-index`` and ``origin_smiles`` for the SMILES string (molecule) of origin (useful for later if we want to e.g. train on small molecules and predict on big ones). Note that any O (C) spectra with any intensity value greater than 5 (10) in the first 10 (35) grid points was discarded (these are generally un-physical, or at the very least, extreme outliers).

XANES database 22 June 2022
===========================

**Filename:** ``XANES-220622-C-N-O.pkl``

Calculations run on the Brookhaven National Laboratory Institutional Cluster: QM9 database Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen XANES calculated using FEFF.

To read the data, you can use ``pickle``\ :

.. code-block:: python

   import pickle
   data = pickle.load(open("XANES-220622-C-N-O.pkl", "rb"))

Data summary
------------

The data is contained in simple serializable form: a Python dictionary. It is organized as follows.


* ``data.keys()`` are the QM9 ID's e.g. "787"
* ``data[QM9_ID].keys()`` are the various data for each QM9 id

  * ``data[QM9_ID]["smiles"]``\ : the SMILES string of the molecule
  * ``data[QM9_ID]["canon_smiles"]``\ : the canonical SMILES string of the molecule
  * ``data[QM9_ID]["other"]``\ : other data corresponding to the molecule. These properties are described in the next section and are probably not going to be very important for our XAS work.
  * ``data[QM9_ID]["zwitter"]``\ : if True, this molecule is a zwitter-ionic species. These molecules should probably be avoided in our datasets.
  * ``data[QM9_ID]["molecule"]``\ : the serialized version of the ``pymatgen.core.structure.Molecule`` object created using the ``monty.json.MSONable`` library. A ``Molecule`` can be initialized via ``Molecule.from_dict(data[QM9_ID]["molecule"])``.
  * `data[QM9_ID]["xanes"]`: the calculated FEFF XANES data. This is also a dictionary: the keys are ``{site}_{absorbing_atom}`` strings.

    * ``data[QM9_ID]["xanes"][KEY]["feff.inp"]``\ : the verbatim FEFF input file used in the calculation.
    * ``data[QM9_ID]["xanes"][KEY]["feff.out"]``\ : the verbatim FEFF output file used in the calculation.
    * ``data[QM9_ID]["xanes"][KEY]["spectrum_metadata"]``\ : the verbatim comment lines in ``xmu.dat``.
    * ``data[QM9_ID]["xanes"][KEY]["spectrum"]``\ : the ``xmu.dat`` file read via ``np.loadtxt(..., comment="#")``. The important columns are ``0`` and ``3``\ , which are the energy grid and XANES intensities, respectively.

**Note**\ : in order to be useful for ML purposes, all spectra must be interpolated onto a common energy grid. The energy grids for each of the site spectra are not necessarily the same (in fact, they are almost always different). The default grids we use are

.. code-block:: python

   N = 200
   grids = {
       "O": np.linspace(528, 582, N),
       "N": np.linspace(395, 449, N),
       "C": np.linspace(275, 329, N)
   }

**Note**\ : not every FEFF calculation completed. These situations should end up with the ``spectrum`` and ``spectrum_metadata`` as ``None``. In situations where not every calculation completes for some molecule, that molecular signal cannot be completed and thus that data point should not be used in a database where full molecular signals are considered.
